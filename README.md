# Bitbucket Command Line Interface

This project gives you a Command Line Interface (CLI) for remotely access [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). This provides an automatically method for adminstrating Bitbucket repository.

## Usage

```
Usage: bbcli --action <action> --file <file> --user <username> --pass <password>
  --action <action>
        Requested operation to be performed.
  --file <file>
        The input data file in csv format.
  --user <username>
        Username of Bitbucket account.
  --pass <password>
        Password of Bitbucket account.
```

You can find the full action document in [usage](Usage.txt) document. There are some examples [here](example.md).

### Input format

The input of the action is described in `csv` format. The first line must be the header. For example, the following file includes 1 header row and  2 data rows; there are 3 columns names `repoId`, `scm`, `isPrivate`.

```
repoId, scm, isPrivate
abc, git, true
def, hg, false
```

Note that the columns orders are not important, as long as you provided all necessary parameters for that action.
